## Embedded Systems with C
This class had us using C to control a TI CC3220S-LaunchXL microcontroller.

### Morse Code
In this project, the goal was to create a simple morse code message that could be toggled between 
SOS and OK by pressing on of the buttons on the side of the microcontroller.

### Thermostat
In this project, the goal was to create a thermostat that uses the temperature sensor on the 
microcontroller to read the ambient temperature of the room, one of the side buttons to increase
the desired temperature, and the other side buttons to decrease the desired tempurature.
